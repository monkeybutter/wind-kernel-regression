Non parametric regression library for wind speed forecasting

This code has been used to perform the experiments contained in a paper submitted to the Weather and Forecasting Journal with title "A method for Wind Speed Forecasting in Airports Based on Non-Parametric Regression".

/data folder contains the csv files with the raw data coming from the GFS Numerical Weather Model and METAR observations for the airports of Foronda, Loiu and Hondarribia in northern Spain.

/bin folder contains the python code to perform different non-parametric regression techniques for wind speed forecasting. To replicate the experiments a >2.7 Python interpreter is required and the following python libraries should be installed:

* numpy
* pandas
* ggplot
